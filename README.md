The Xing Framework is a cutting edge web and mobile development platform by
Logical Reality Design, Inc.  It is designed to provide a completely modern
(and even somewhat future-proofed) API + SPA web development platform with
sensible defaults, solid conventions, and ease of rapid development. Xing uses
Rails (4.2) on the backend and AngularJS (1.4) on the frontend.  Most of the
problems inherent in getting these two frameworks to talk to each other cleanly
have been pre-solved in Xing.

This package provides the scaffolding and default configuration for Xing's frontend build process, which is based on Grunt.
